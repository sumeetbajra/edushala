# RS Core Framework
This library contains handly utilities that are most commonly used in our development.

If you see yourself writing or copying the same functions over and over again across multiple projects, it may need to be included in this library. Please create pull request to update the library. Also please checkout [rs.data](/rs/data) for data related utilities.
