                        <p>“The concept of selling isn’t cool,” says Steven Osinski, a sales expert at University. “But the truth is so many businesses have gone under because they don’t know how to sell. You can have the greatest product or service on the market, but without sales strategies, you’ll never get it off the ground.” </p>
                        <p>Keeping this in mind Edushala conducted a Sales Workshop for WorldLink. WorldLink has been a leading ISP in Nepal market. They provide best in class internet service in Nepal. So to further reach to deep Nepali market for the first time internet consumers WorldLink has been the best choice for many Nepali consumers. So in order to boost their sakes as well have a good consumer relation WorldLink needed a force of trained employees who could not only provide best in class consumer services but also promote its brand indirectly through a better sales strategies and a better workforce who could promote their influence in Nepali market. </p>
                        <p>Edushala provided a platform to make this possible. Edushala has been conducting workshop with experts and specialists on the field for corporate trainings as well as professional development. </p>
