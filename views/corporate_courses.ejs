                                    People have generally evaluated an event as being negative in some way and may have decided that they lack the resources to cope with the situation they are confronted with.
                                    Stress management in the workplace requires more than helpful tips. Changing economic times have us pulled in multiple directions. The pressures and demands between work and personal life are blurred. As a result, the consequences of stress in the workplace come from what is happening to each of us both on and off the job. Through highly interactive learning, participants apply these stress management training tools to getting more of what's important to them done in less time. Organizational skills are improved so that less things "fall through the cracks."

                                    Microsoft Access is a menu-driven database program that includes a graphical user interface enabling novice users to enter, manage and report on their data. Data can be entered using a familiar spreadsheet or table interface and the program will automatically generate forms based upon the data and labels that have been entered. Routine tasks such as searches, sorts and queries can be automated with macros using a point-and-click paradigm. Reports can be formatted by dragging and dropping fields on a graphical interface and the program includes many templates that can be easily modified by end users. Word documents can be easily customized with contact and supplier records within an Access database, and Excel can be used as a front end to enter and update Access database information in real time.
